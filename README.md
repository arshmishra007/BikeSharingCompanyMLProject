## General Information
BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, has been severely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, causing a significant dip in its revenues. This project aims to develop a multiple linear regression model to predict bike demand (cnt) based on various factors such as weather conditions, time, and seasonal variations.

## Conclusions
- Weather conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity) and time variables (e.g., year, season) strongly influence bike demand.
- Demand Patterns: Higher demand is observed during winter seasons and working days.
- Impact of Year: The year variable indicates an increasing trend in bike-sharing popularity
- Optimization Potential: Understanding these demand drivers enables efficient resource allocation and improved customer satisfaction.
